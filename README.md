# APR-Survey
**A Survey on Automated Program Repair Techniques**

With the rapid development and large-scale popularity of program software, modern society increasingly relies on software systems.
However, the problems exposed by software have also come to the fore. Software bugs have become important factors troubling developers. 
Automated Program Repair (APR) techniques were born to fix software problems automatically and reduce the manual debugging work. 
It improves software quality and reliability by finding and fixing latent defects. 
To give researchers a quick overview of the complete development and the current challenges of APR techniques, we provide a detailed survey. 
Moreover, we propose a uniform set of criteria to review and compare each APR tool, summarize the advantages and disadvantages of APR techniques, and discuss the current state of APR development. Furthermore, we introduce the research on the related technical areas of APR that have also provided a strong motivation to advance APR development. 
Finally, we analyze current challenges, especially the resistance to industrial deployment, and suggest future directions.
